We welcome contributions of all kinds â€” bug fixes, new features, improvements to documentation, or even just feedback and ideas.

The codebase may not follow strict conventions everywhere, and there's definitely room for improvement in structure, patterns, and organization. Don't hesitate to suggest refactors, improvements, or better practices â€” we're here to learn and improve together!
